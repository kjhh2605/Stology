# Figma PM Wireframe

## Purpose

Produce a PM wireframe specification in Figma, not a polished UI design. The artifact must help PMs, designers, and developers understand screen purpose, state/case variants, user actions, transitions, permissions, empty/error states, and implementation boundaries.

Use this skill when the user asks for:

- `PM 와이어프레임`, `화면설계서`, `화면 설계`, `wireframe specification`
- Figma artifacts based on a guideline/reference file
- feature-by-feature or case-by-case screen organization
- numbered callouts plus `화면설명(Description)` tables
- user-flow notes, screen IDs, screen paths, states, permissions, empty/error cases
- revising an existing or legacy wireframe to match new planning docs

## Core Inputs

Before building or revising, inspect the available project context. Do not assume a specific service structure.

1. Project instructions:
   - `AGENTS.md`, project README, or local workflow notes when present
   - user corrections in the latest messages; newer requests override older nonessential details
2. Product and planning docs:
   - PRD, product brief, planning doc, functional spec, change log, policy doc
   - screen requirements, IA, user-flow docs, acceptance criteria
   - MVP/deferred scope notes
3. Figma references:
   - guideline file or PM template file
   - legacy wireframe file, if the user wants reuse
   - target output file/page
4. Product-specific context:
   - service name, domain terms, user roles, permissions, platform, primary flows
   - brand/design-system constraints only where they affect wireframe clarity

If a project has specific files such as `docs/기획안.md` or `docs/wire_frame_requirements`, treat them as project-local inputs, not as assumptions baked into this skill.

## Figma Rules

- Load `figma:figma-use` before every `use_figma` call.
- Return created/mutated node IDs from every Figma write script.
- Keep PM wireframes mostly structural. Use brand color only as a restrained accent unless the user asks for a higher-fidelity artifact.
- Do not add unsupported features. Put excluded or deferred items only in an explicit out-of-scope/common-out frame or note.
- Preserve legacy layouts only when they still match the current docs and latest user intent.
- Remove obsolete service language from reused screens unless current docs explicitly require it.
- Keep annotations editable and click-safe: do not leave a page/frame-level `Callout Overlay` that groups all red numbers together. Prefer one unlocked group per number, named `Callout 1`, `Callout 2`, etc. This lets users select and edit each red number independently without a full-screen layer blocking the wireframe.

## Required Work Loop

For corrections or large PM wireframe updates, work page by page.

1. **Project profile**
   - Extract the product name, platform, core users, main objects, roles/permissions, lifecycle states, and MVP boundaries.
   - Build a short glossary from the docs and use those exact terms in screens and Description rows.
2. **Document map**
   - For each required frame, extract: screen purpose, visible UI elements, state/case variants, permissions, button behavior, destinations, empty/error text, and required Description rows.
   - When the workload is large and the user asks for parallel work, split analysis by independent feature groups. Example lanes:
     - entry/auth/onboarding/home
     - primary feature area A
     - primary feature area B
     - review/approval/reporting
     - settings/common states
   - Do not force these lanes; derive them from the product docs.
3. **Current Figma audit**
   - Inspect the target Figma page, frame list, and existing naming convention.
   - For every frame, compare the document map against visible UI, `화면설명(Description)`, red callout numbers, user-flow note, connectors, state variants, and modal/popup behavior.
   - Record mismatches before editing so corrections are traceable.
4. **Patch**
   - Update only what the docs or latest user correction require.
   - Rebuild or repair Description rows and callouts together, not independently.
   - Add missing case frames when they are in scope: empty state, loading, error, disabled submit, edit/delete modal, destructive confirmation, read-only/archived/ended state, permission-denied state, feedback/toast state.
5. **Verify**
   - Run an automated Figma audit.
   - Capture representative screenshots and visually inspect actual readability, not just node counts.

## PM Artifact Structure

Use a screen-spec layout that mirrors PM documentation:

```text
[Top Metadata Table]
Screen Path / 화면명
Screen ID / 기능 정의
Application to / Related docs

[Main Wireframe Area]
Platform frame, e.g. Web 1920 x 1080 or mobile size from docs
Left/center: actual wireframe
Right: 화면설명(Description)
Bottom/right: 사용자 플로우 note

[Annotations]
Numbered red callouts on UI areas
Matching Description rows
```

For feature grouping, arrange frames as feature/case sequences:

```text
01. Feature Main SCREEN_ID
01-01. Feature Empty STATE_ID
01-02. Feature Create MODAL_ID
01-03. Feature Error ERROR_ID
```

Prefer one feature row with detail/case frames left-to-right when working on a broad canvas. When editing an existing file, preserve the established frame grid unless the current structure blocks comprehension.

## Screen Coverage Planning

Derive screen coverage from the docs. Common groups to consider:

- Entry: login, signup, onboarding, invitation/deep-link entry
- Home/dashboard/list: first post-login view, cards, activity logs, recent items
- Create/edit/detail flows: form states, validation, success, failure, confirmation
- Shared container/navigation: sidebar, topbar, tabs, breadcrumbs, profile, global actions
- Primary feature screens: list, detail, filter, search, sort, panel, drawer, popup
- Input/import/upload flows when present: file, text, URL, validation, pending states
- Review/approval flows when present: candidate cards, reviewer status, approve/reject, disabled submit, done branches
- Reporting/analytics flows when present: summary, charts, pending/unavailable state
- Communication flows when present: comments, replies, questions, edit/delete, empty state
- Settings/share/invite flows when present: role-only actions, modal, copy feedback
- Common states: empty, loading, error, permission, read-only, archived/ended, toast/spinner/network failure

Do not create all groups by default. Include only what is supported by the product docs or user request.

## Reuse Policy

When a legacy Figma file exists:

- Reuse broad structure where still valid:
  - entry screen base
  - dashboard/card/list layout
  - shared navigation/header/tabs
  - primary data canvas or panel pattern
  - form/list/detail/review/report patterns
- Adapt terminology and interaction policy to current docs.
- Remove obsolete screens, labels, permissions, and states even if they exist in the old file.
- If the user's old wireframe intentionally reflects product thinking, preserve the spatial structure where it still matches the updated spec.

## Visual Construction Pattern

For product screens:

- Use the platform size stated in docs. If unspecified, web PM specs commonly use `1920 x 1080`; mobile specs should use the product's target device size.
- Keep visual style low/mid fidelity unless the user asks for high fidelity.
- Use a consistent shared layout for repeated surfaces: navigation, topbar, header, tabs, profile, global action area.
- For pre-auth screens, avoid post-auth navigation unless required.
- For post-auth screens, keep global navigation and profile placement consistent.
- For tabbed or multi-section products, keep tab order fixed across related frames once established by docs.

For numbered callouts:

- Put each red callout in its own unlocked group named `Callout 1`, `Callout 2`, etc.
- Each callout group contains exactly its matching circle and text:
  - `Callout Circle 1`
  - `Callout Text 1`
- Add the callout groups as the last children of the screen frame so they are never hidden behind other layers.
- Do not keep all callouts inside one page/frame-level `Callout Overlay` group in the final file. That makes the numbers feel page-level grouped and harder to edit individually.
- Do not use a full-frame transparent annotation frame in the final file. It can block selection of the real wireframe.
- Name children consistently:
  - `Callout Circle 1`
  - `Callout Text 1`
- Match numbers exactly to Description rows: `1..N`.
- Place callouts near the target UI, but not on top of readable text.
- Do not place callouts on button labels, form labels, table text, node labels, or other text that the PM/developer needs to read. If the target is a button or input, place the red circle just outside the component edge or in nearby whitespace.
- Avoid callout-to-callout overlap; move numbers apart even if they point to nearby UI.
- Users should be able to select/edit each callout directly in the final file. If clicking a red number selects all page callouts together, split them into per-number groups before delivery.

For relationship/graph/canvas screens:

- Add each connector as its own unlocked direct layer named `Graph Edge 1`, `Graph Edge 2`, etc.
- Do not leave all connectors inside one `Graph Connectors` frame/group in the final file. Users should be able to select and adjust each edge independently.
- Keep graph edges above the canvas background and below node labels/callouts.
- Make relationship states visually distinct when the docs require it, such as selected, related, active, inactive, source, target, warning, or disabled.

## Description Writing

Write implementation-ready text in the user's language. Korean is appropriate when the project docs/user request are Korean.

- Buttons: state click behavior and destination.
- Lists/tables: define sort order, row contents, status badge behavior, pagination, and empty state.
- Forms: required/optional fields, validation, active/disabled CTA conditions, success/failure result.
- Modals/popups/drawers: open condition, confirm/cancel/close behavior, destructive confirmation.
- Permissions: prefer hiding unavailable actions; if visible, disable with reason.
- Read-only/archived/ended state: specify what remains viewable and what write actions are blocked.
- Out-of-scope features: keep out of the main UI and document separately.
- Keep Description rows semantically aligned with the red callout target. If red number `3` points to a list status badge, row `3` must describe that exact badge and behavior.
- Prefer concise, testable rows over broad prose. Include active/disabled/hidden behavior where relevant.

## Terminology

- Build a glossary from project docs before writing screen text.
- Use the product's own terms for objects, roles, actions, states, and permissions.
- Do not hard-code terms from previous projects.
- When revising a legacy file, replace obsolete labels with current glossary terms.

## Final QA Checklist

Run a Figma script audit and representative screenshots before claiming completion.

Required checks:

- Every frame has metadata appropriate to the chosen template: screen path/name, screen ID, purpose/function, related docs.
- Every frame has `화면설명(Description)` or equivalent explanation table and a user-flow note where the template requires it.
- Description row count equals red callout count.
- Description row numbers and callout numbers are exactly `1..N`, with no missing or duplicated numbers.
- Red callouts are direct per-number groups named `Callout N` at the top of each screen frame.
- No page/frame-level `Callout Overlay` remains in the final file unless the user explicitly wants grouped annotation editing.
- Each `Callout N` group is unlocked and contains one `Callout Circle N` plus one `Callout Text N`.
- Red callouts do not overlap each other.
- Red callouts do not cover readable text.
- Text does not leave its frame or component.
- Visible text does not unintentionally overlap.
- Shared navigation/header/tabs are consistent across related screens.
- Pre-auth and post-auth layouts do not accidentally mix states.
- Relationship/graph/canvas screens have visible individually editable `Graph Edge N` layers when connectors are part of the product concept.
- Modal foreground text is not confused with background screen text; use an opaque card/backdrop.
- If an automated overlap check reports modal/background coordinate collisions, confirm with screenshots that the foreground card/backdrop actually hides the background content.
- Final screenshots cover at least:
  - a main/home/list screen
  - one primary feature screen
  - one modal or popup
  - one complex state screen such as expanded/detail/review/error/read-only
